### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Emmanuel and I work for the greatest firm raised in France: [Talend](https://talend.com)!

Checkout or star our [repos](https://github.com/Talend) ;-)

As a side note: 
- I love and over-use [Emacs](https://gnu.org/software/emacs), but not a great lisper :-( 
- I use [GUIX](https://guix.gnu.org/) as my second OS ;-)
- I use [stumpwm](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm) as my WM
- I use [qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/) which is for me the BEST browser ever made (dispite I hate Qt)!
